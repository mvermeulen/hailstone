Computations of hailstone numbers (Collatz conjecture).  In particular:

T(n) = n*3+1 if n is odd
       n/2   if n is even

where: steps is number of iterations of T before it reaches 1 and maxvalue
is the maximum value reached.  See also:

Started playing with this in 1986 and was coauthor on a paper in 1990 -

Since then an off/on hobby including these codes redone in 2014.
